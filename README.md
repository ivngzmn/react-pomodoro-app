# Pomodoro App made with React

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. **Source:** [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique "Pomodoro Technique")

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Tailwind, React

I have been learning about different studying techniques on how to focus and the pomodoro technique is one that I truly love. I started to build the app in react and was using regular CSS but I had heard of Tailwind being easier to build prototypes fast. I went ahead and began adding Tailwind to the project. Now it was not easy but after a few google searches I was able to get Tailwind to work in compatibility mode until React is able to handle the most recent iteration of Tailwind CSS. Once Tailwind CSS was ready, I was off to the races. Now that the app functionality is done my next step is to add some sound when the timer goes off.

## Lessons Learned:

When working with this project I had just began to work with Node and now I have a better understanding on how package dependencies work. I have grown to love Yarn as it just makes life easier. Moving forward I will make a boilerplate for my React apps to include Tailwind CSS.
